	We know from Anderson et. al. 2012 that there is a signal due to Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations from the recombination period of our universe.  This signal shows that the amount of dark matter in our universe controls the acceleration of our universe over time.  We find the signal by using a statistical estimator from a sample and weighting it over the total distance between a pair of galaxies squared.  This signal peaks at about 150 Mpc in configuration space.
	One project that we are undertaking is to try to determine an alternative theory to dark matter for this signal.  This can be done by using the fiducial galaxy sample used for the BAO analysis.  If we can provide that the signal is being generated by real galaxies, then we can show that the signal is not a result of the dark matter in our universe.  In other words, this would show that dark matter does not exist.  We can use our fiducial sample to create a catalog of "BAO circles."
	If we randomly select a certain number of galaxies, we can search for the number of real galaxies at 150 Mpc from each source.  Once we know the amount of galaxies spaced that distance away, we can map all of those galaxies around each respective source.  This gives us a better idea of whether or not the signal is actually coming from real sources.  If the BAO signal is coming from these real galaxies, then dark matter is not the cuase of the acceleration of our universe.
	We can generate as many of these "BAO spheres" as we choose by determining the location of all of the galaxies located at the estimated source of our signal.  This then creates a sphere of all of the galaxies we expect to see.  We can then create a map of all of these spheres for each of our random sources.  If we want, we can do this over a volume as well.  This should give a realistic map of our universe in terms of the BAO signal.  This would also show that the signal comes from real sources, rather than dark matter.
